# Acoustic_Attack_Analyses
Acoustic attack on hard disk drives (HDD) causes higher position error signal (PES) and may lead to failure of servers inside a data center. In this project, we design an attack detection and localization technique by leveraging PES data and external information such as mechanical vibration.
